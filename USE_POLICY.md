maximum extent permitted by law, BareBits and its creators disclaim liability for your deployment, modifications,
integrations, and downstream use, and provide the Software “as is” with no warranties. BareBits does not provide a
hosted service unless you have a separate written Service Agreement.

By accessing or using the Website or the Software, you, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent (Customer or
you), agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (these Terms). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or
use the Website or Software.

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Zaphaus LLC. website located at getbarebits.com, along with any related
pages, portals, dashboards, or online services provided by Zaphaus LLC. (collectively, the Website). The Website may
provide information about the Software and may enable access to certain features of the Software.

## 3.3 Software

These Terms also govern your installation, access, and use of the Zaphaus LLC payment processing software, including any
applications, tools, features, updates, and documentation made available by Zaphaus LLC. (collectively, the Software).
The Software is licensed to you under a separate license agreement provided with the Software (the “License Agreement”).

license agreement for each is included in our software package. By using our Software, you inherently agree to those

respect to the relevant Open Source Component, and these Terms will otherwise continue to apply to the Website and
Software.

## 3.5 Relationship to Other Agreements

These Terms are the general controlling terms for access to and use of the Website and Software. If you have entered
into a separate written agreement with Us that specifically governs payment processing services or other products or
services (a Service Agreement), that Service Agreement is not part of these Terms and will control to the extent it
conflicts with these Terms.

# 4. Description of Service

Zaphaus LLC. ("Company," "we," or "us") provides payment processing software designed to facilitate financial

# 12. Term and Termination

These Terms remain in effect while Customer accesses or uses the Website or Software, unless terminated as provided
here.

(a) Termination by Company. The Company may suspend or terminate Customer access to the Website or Software, and may
terminate these Terms, at any time, with or without notice, if the Company reasonably believes Customer has violated
these Terms, the License Agreement, or applicable law, or if continued access could create risk or liability for the
Company or any third party. The Company may also terminate these Terms for convenience by providing notice through the
Website or by other reasonable means.

(b) Termination by Customer. Customer may terminate these Terms at any time by discontinuing all access to and use of
the Website and Software.

(c) Effect of termination. Upon termination, Customer must immediately cease all use of the Website and Software.
Termination does not relieve Customer of any obligations accrued before termination.

(d) Survival. Sections 3, 6, 7, and 8 will survive termination, along with any other provisions that by their nature are
intended to survive, including provisions regarding ownership, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification,
and dispute resolution.

# 13. Intellectual Property and Feedback

(a) Company ownership. The Website and Software, including all related intellectual property rights, are and will remain
the exclusive property of the Company and its licensors. Except as expressly granted in the License Agreement, no rights
are granted to Customer by implication or otherwise.

(b) Feedback. If Customer provides suggestions, ideas, or feedback regarding the Website or Software, Customer grants
the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty free right to use and incorporate such feedback without
restriction or obligation.

in the Software or documentation, except to the extent permitted by the applicable License Agreement or Open Source

deployment is self-hosted and operated by Customer, not by the Company.

constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If Customer does not agree to the updated Terms, Customer must stop using
the Website and Software.

# 15. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Wyoming, without regard to conflict of law
principles.

# 16. Dispute Resolution

## 16.1 Informal Resolution. 

Before initiating mediation, arbitration, or a small claims action, either Party may provide written notice of the dispute (a “Dispute Notice”) describing the issue and the relief requested. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Dispute Notice.

## 16.2 Mandatory Mediation. 

If the dispute is not resolved through informal efforts, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to non-binding mediation before commencing arbitration, except as provided in Section 16.4 (Small Claims). Mediation will be administered by JAMS (or another mutually agreed mediator) and will occur in Laramie County, Wyoming (or remotely by video conference if the Parties agree). The Parties will share mediator fees equally, and each Party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs, unless the mediator allocates fees by written agreement of the Parties.

## 16.3 Binding Arbitration. 

If the dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after a written request for mediation (or such other period as the Parties agree), the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (or, for claims within the applicable threshold, its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures), as then in effect. The arbitration will be conducted by one (1) arbitrator, seated in Laramie County, Wyoming, and conducted in English. The arbitrator will have authority to award any relief available in court, except that the arbitrator may not award punitive or exemplary damages except to the extent permitted by applicable law and not waived by these Terms. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

## 16.4 Small Claims Exception. 

Either Party may bring an individual action in small claims court in Laramie County, Wyoming, so long as the claim remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.

## 16.5 Injunctive Relief. 

Nothing in this Section prevents either Party from seeking temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent immediate and irreparable harm (including to protect confidential information, intellectual property, or security). Any such request will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to mediate and arbitrate under this Section for all other relief.

## 16.6 Class Action Waiver; Individual Basis Only. 

All disputes must be brought in the Parties’ individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, or private attorney general proceeding. The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

## 16.7 Time Limit. 

Any claim arising out of or relating to the Website, Software, or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after the claim arose, unless a longer period is required by applicable law.

# 17. Assignment

Customer may not assign or transfer these Terms without the Company prior written consent. The Company may assign these
Terms without restriction, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of
assets. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section is void.

# 18. Force Majeure

The Company will not be liable for any delay, failure, or interruption of the Website or Software caused by events
beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, power failures,
internet or hosting failures, cyber attacks, or failures of blockchain networks or other payment rails.

# 19. Severability and Entire Agreement for Website Use

(a) Severability. If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force.
(b) Entire agreement. These Terms, together with any policies expressly referenced in them, are the entire agreement
between Customer and the Company regarding Customer access to and use of the Website, and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous understandings on that subject. The License Agreement and any Service Agreement are separate agreements
that govern their respective subject matters.
